            Rare is to born as a human. <br /> <br />
            Rarer is to be endowed with good health and wellness. <br /> <br />
            If this becomes possible, still rarer is to get good education and obtain thinking ability. <br /> <br />
            If someone gets all these, then rarest is dedicating his entire life to the enquiry and experiments of synthesis of Science and spirituality. <br /> <br />
            When someone starts living such a selfless illumining life and understands the nature of ultimate reality then, not only the angels come to welcome him to the portals of heaven but the god himself takes him into his own arms and merges his self into his own self. <br /> <br />
            This is self realization! This is enlightenment. This is liberation. <br /> <br />
